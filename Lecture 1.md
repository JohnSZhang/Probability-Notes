* Sample Space
    This is the set of all possible outcomes of an event. The set should be mutually exclusive and collective exhaustive. Ie, they should contain all outcomes and only one outcome can occur at a time.

    Events are subsets of the total sample space.

* Probability Axioms
    Probability of any event A should be nonnegative P(A) >= 0

    Sum of all Probabilities of the sample space should = 1 (since our sample space is collective exhaustive)

    If events A and B share no common elements A intersect B = Null Set, then P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B). (And if we have a sequence of Probabilities, such as a geometric series, then their total Probability is the sum of the sequence)

* Discrete Uniform Law
    If all outcomes are equally likely (there are n such outcomes), then each outcome of P(A) must equal to 1 / n.

* Continuous Uniform Law
    Probability of an outcome is the same as it's area / total area of the sample space.

* Text book notes
    Omega represents the universal set, while ⊂ is the symbol for 'subset of' and ⊃ stands for 'superset of'.

    Sets are disjoined if they do not have any common elements. And a collection of sets is called a partition of a set S if the collection's sets are disjointed and their union is the entire set S.

    Demorgan's law states that the complement of the unions of a series of sets is the same as the intersection of the sum of the individual complements.
