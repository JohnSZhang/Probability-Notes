* Independence
    Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event will not alter the probability of the other, and vice versa.

    P(B|A) = P(B), that P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

    For events n > 2, we need to not only look at the pair wise independence events but also the probability of all events together. Ie P(A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3) = P(A1) * P(A2) * P(A3)

* From Book
    If an experiment involves a series of independent stages then we have a sequence of independent trials. If there are only two possible results at each stage then we have a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. 

    (n k) "n choose k" is the binomial coefficient, and Probability k is the binomial probability.
